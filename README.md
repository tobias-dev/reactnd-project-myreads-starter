# MyReads Project

This application displays a list of shelves and books contained in it. The application also allows to search for books and (re-)assign to the shelves.

The search is limited to a particular set of search terms, which can be found in [SEARCH_TERMS.md](SEARCH_TERMS.md).

This is implemented based on the following starter template: https://github.com/udacity/reactnd-project-myreads-starter
